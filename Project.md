In previous project [Implementing Web Solution] (https://github.com/Omolade11/Web-Solution-using-WordPress-and-MySQL)  I implemented a WordPress based solution that is ready to be filled with content and can be used as a full fledged website or blog. Moving further I will add some more value to my solution so that a member of a DevOps team could utilize.

In this project, we will implement a solution that consists of following components:
1. Infrastructure: AWS
2. Webserver Linux: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
3. Database Server: Ubuntu 20.04 + MySQL
4. Storage Server: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 + NFS Server
5. Programming Language: PHP
6. Code Repository: GitHub


On the diagram below, we can see a common pattern where several stateless Web Servers share a common database and also access the same files using [Network File Sytem (NFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System) as a shared file storage. Even though the NFS server might be located on a completely separate hardware â€“ for Web Servers it look like a local file system from where they can serve the same files.
